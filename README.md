Odoo Python Developer Interview Preparation Guide
This guide provides a concise overview of key topics for an Odoo Python Developer interview. Focus on understanding the concepts and being able to explain them, rather than just memorizing definitions.

Page 1: Odoo Fundamentals & Backend Development
1. Odoo Overview & Architecture
What is Odoo?

An open-source, all-in-one business management software (ERP, CRM, Accounting, Sales, Inventory, etc.).

Modular architecture: built as a collection of interconnected applications/modules.

Odoo Editions:

Community: Open-source, free, core ERP functionalities.

Enterprise: Paid, proprietary features (e.g., Studio, MRP, advanced accounting, mobile app), maintained by Odoo S.A.

Key Architectural Components:

MVC (Model-View-Controller): Odoo generally follows this pattern.

Models: Python classes defining data structures and business logic (the 'M').

Views: XML files defining the user interface (the 'V').

Controllers: Python code handling web requests (for website/API, less common for standard backend modules).

ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Odoo's powerful layer that abstracts database interactions. You work with Python objects, and Odoo translates them into SQL.

PostgreSQL: The required database backend.

2. Python Fundamentals (Relevant to Odoo)
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Odoo is heavily OOP-based.

Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation.

super() for calling parent methods (crucial in Odoo inheritance).

Decorators: @api.model, @api.depends, @api.constrains are fundamental in Odoo. Understand how decorators work generally.

Data Structures: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets. Odoo ORM methods often return recordsets (similar to lists of records).

Context: Understand the context dictionary in Odoo methods for passing session-specific information.

Error Handling: try-except blocks.

Basic Python syntax and readability (PEP 8).

3. Odoo Backend Development: Models & Fields
odoo.models.Model: The base class for all Odoo models.

_name: Technical name of the model (e.g., estate.property).

_description: Human-readable name.

_inherit: For extending existing models (e.g., _inherit = 'res.partner').

_inherits: For delegation inheritance.

_order: Default sorting for records.

Common Field Types (odoo.fields):

Char, Text, Integer, Float, Boolean, Date, Datetime.

Relational Fields:

Many2one: Link to one record in another model (e.g., property_type_id = fields.Many2one('estate.property.type')).

One2many: List of records in another model linked to this one (inverse of Many2one).

Many2many: Link to multiple records in another model.

Selection: Dropdown list with predefined values.

Field Attributes:

string: Display label.

required=True: Makes the field mandatory.

readonly=True: Makes the field non-editable.

default: Default value for new records.

help: Tooltip text.

copy=False: Prevents field value from being copied when duplicating a record.

invisible=True: Hides the field in views (Odoo 17+ for XML).

4. Odoo Backend Development: ORM Methods, Computed Fields, Constraints
Basic ORM Methods:

create(vals): Creates a new record.

write(vals): Updates existing records.

unlink(): Deletes records.

search(domain, order=..., limit=...): Finds records matching a domain. Returns a recordset.

browse(ids): Gets a recordset from a list of IDs.

read(fields): Reads field values for records.

Recordsets: Understand that ORM methods operate on recordsets (collections of records), not individual records directly. Iterating over self in methods is common.

Computed Fields:

Defined with compute='_compute_method_name'.

Method decorated with @api.depends('field1', 'field2').

Method calculates value based on other fields.

Constraints:

SQL Constraints (_sql_constraints): Tuple of (name, SQL_constraint, message). Enforced at the database level.

Python Constraints (@api.constrains): Method decorated with @api.constrains('field1', 'field2'). Raises ValidationError if condition not met.

Wizards (Transient Models):

_name = "model.name.wizard", _transient = True.

Used for temporary forms or actions that don't persist data.

Typically used for multi-step processes or actions that require user input before executing a backend method.

Page 2: Odoo Frontend, Module Structure & Workflow
5. Odoo Frontend Development: Views, Actions, Menus
XML View Structure:

<odoo>: Root tag.

<record>: Defines a UI component (view, action, menu) in the database.

<field name="arch" type="xml">: Contains the actual view definition.

View Types:

<tree> (List View): Displays records in a table. <field> tags define columns.

decoration-danger, decoration-success, etc.: For conditional row coloring.

<form> (Form View): Displays a single record for editing.

<sheet>, <group>: For layout and organization.

<widget>: Embeds specialized UI components (e.g., web_ribbon, mail_followers).

invisible="field_name": Odoo 17+ for conditional visibility.

<div class="oe_chatter">: For communication features (followers, activities, messages).

<search> (Search View): Defines search fields, filters, and group-by options.

<field>: Fields to search on.

<filter>: Predefined filters (domain attribute).

<group>: For grouping options (context attribute with group_by).

Window Actions (ir.actions.act_window):

Links a model to its available views.

res_model: The target model.

view_mode: Comma-separated list of view types (e.g., tree,form,kanban).

Menu Items (ir.ui.menu):

menuitem: Defines a clickable menu entry.

id: Unique XML ID.

name: Display label.

parent: XML ID of the parent menu.

action: XML ID of the window action to open.

QWeb (Templating Engine):

Used for rendering reports, website pages, and dynamic parts of the backend UI.

Syntax similar to Jinja2 or Twig (e.g., t-esc, t-if, t-foreach).

6. Odoo Module Structure & Data Loading
Module Directory: Contains __init__.py, __manifest__.py, and subdirectories.

__init__.py:

In the module root: from . import models, controllers, wizards, etc.

In subdirectories (e.g., models/__init__.py): from . import file1, file2, etc.

Purpose: Tells Python which files to load when the module is imported.

__manifest__.py:

'name': Module name.

'version': Module version.

'depends': List of other Odoo modules this module relies on (e.g., 'base', 'mail'). These are installed first.

'data': List of XML and CSV files that contain data to be loaded into the database when the module is installed/updated. Order matters! (e.g., security files before views, views before menus that reference their actions).

'installable', 'application', 'auto_install': Flags for module behavior.

Data Loading Order: Odoo processes files in the 'data' list sequentially. If an XML record refers to another record (via its XML ID) that hasn't been processed yet, it will fail.

7. Security & Access Rights
ir.model.access.csv:

Defines basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions for models based on user groups.

Columns: id, name, model_id:id, group_id:id, perm_read, perm_write, perm_create, perm_unlink.

Record Rules (ir.rule - defined in XML):

More granular security. Filters records that a user can access based on specific conditions (e.g., "only show records where user_id is the current user").

Defined using <record model="ir.rule"> with a domain.

8. Development Workflow & Best Practices
Module Installation/Upgrade: Understand odoo-bin -u module_name or docker-compose restart web followed by module upgrade in UI.

Debugging:

Python: pdb or PyCharm's debugger.

XML/UI: Odoo's Developer Mode (debug mode) in the browser is invaluable.

Server Logs: Check docker-compose logs web for detailed error tracebacks.

Version Control (Git): Essential for team collaboration and tracking changes.

Modularity: Keep your code organized and focused within modules.

Inheritance vs. Overriding: Prefer inheritance (_inherit) for extending functionality. Avoid modifying Odoo core files directly.

Performance Considerations: Be mindful of database queries, especially in loops.

9. General Interview Tips
Be Prepared to Explain Your Project: Talk about your estate module, the models, fields, views, and any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

Problem-Solving: Interviewers often ask how you approach problems or debug issues.

Ask Questions: Shows engagement and interest.

Demonstrate Enthusiasm: Show your passion for learning and working with Odoo.

Good luck with your interview!
